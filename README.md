# Beatcoin
•	First, in our project we are going to educate people what Bitcoin is and provide them with related information. This is achieved by implementing the bitcoin news module on the front page. Users are able to learn more about the recent information of bitcoin and thus get to know how to benefit from it. This home page is mainly designed for starters. If they want to know more, they have to sign up to get more information.
•	Second, visualize history data of 4 popular cryptocurrency exchanges. This is a customised interface, which enables users to select the time phase, the types of currencies,  and therefore make their own comparison and analysis. All the works aims at improving the acceptance of digital assets and trying to influence more companies and more people. 
•	Third, steaming virtual currency’s real-time price and exchange rates, with sound and dynamic effects when currency changed, working as a reminder, which is unique to our project. And that is why we called “BEATCOIN”.
•	Prediction function is for supporting user to make their investment decisions. 
We aim to provide a platform that benefits both starters and investors and bring cryptocurrencies exchange to the public. Even for different background user, they can always meet their demands using BEATCOIN.
